# WORMHOLE

Wormhole is an interactive art project that I am building together with my friend Pandora.  
Wormhole is about finding ways to organically and naturally mesh the written word into a natural environment made of visuals and sounds.  

The main page of the project features a forest at night, blanketed by stars. While wind and silence engulf the observer, they may hear the songs of the stars if they listen close enough...



There are some secrets hidden in the project.  
Both Pandora and I would very much appreciate it if you didn't try to find out about them by digging through the project's source code.
The secrets and hidden parts, and especially uncovering them through experiencing it, are part of the artpiece.  
Don't spoil it and yourself. Just enjoy it the way it's meant to be enjoyed. Respect the artist's vision.
